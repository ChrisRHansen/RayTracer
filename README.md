# RayTracer

I am reading a book on computer graphics and created this project to program the concepts I've learned from it. I enjoy doing things like this in my free time to learn new things and broaden my knowledge as a developer.

Currently it supports simple Ray Tracing algorithms with Parallel and Perspective Projection. It also supports Lambertian and Blinn-Phong shading. I've begun working on non-ray tracing viewing methods that utilize view transformations.

Inside of the RayTracer/RayTracer/images directory you can find example output images this project has created. The only external library I needed was something to help create the .png files.

I created this using Visual Studio 2015, if that's relevant.
